This directory contains the top 3000 schemas produced by the system described
in Balasubramanian et al., (2013).

The schemas are represented as a set of (Actor, Relation, Actor) tuples.
Each file contains numbered schemas containing upto 6 top tuples per
schema.

Column description:
runid - Default identifier
schemaid - Identifier ordering the schemas in terms of quality within the file.
Arg1 Instances - Examples instances seen for the first actor if there was a class. The lexical head otherwise.
Arg1 - Semantic class of the first actor if available. [none] indicates no semantic class was determined.
Rel - The action represented via normalized relation string.
Arg2 - Semantic class of the first actor if available. [none] indicates no semantic class was determined.
