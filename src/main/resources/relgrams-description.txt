This directory contains Rel-grams data generated as described in Balasubramanian et al. (2013).
The counts are extracted from 1.8 Million New York Times articles (part of the English Gigaword collection).

There are two directories:

1. rgc -- A set of files that provide bigram co-occurrence counts for generalized tuples (normalized Open IE relation
tuples, with semantic classes for arguments).

2. tuples -- A set of files containing unigram counts for the generalized tuples.

Equality constraints:
--------------------

Sub-directory 'equality' specifies equality constraints i.e., rel-gram counts for pairs,
where at least one of the arguments is the same. The equality constraint is marked via "XVAR" and "YVAR".


File formats:
-------------

a) Rel-gram files: The rows in the rel-gram files contain pairs of tuples (T, T') and two sets of comma-separated counts
that represent directed i.e., T preceding T' (T, T') and undirected co-occcurrence counts (T, T') + (T', T).

Field description:

Fields 1-5 contain information about the first tuple (T).

1. Arg1 - Semantic class of the first actor if available. [none] indicates no semantic class was determined.
2. Arg1 Instances - Examples instances seen for the first actor if there was a class. The lexical head otherwise.
3. Rel - The action represented via normalized relation string.
4. Arg2 - Semantic class of the first actor if available. [none] indicates no semantic class was determined.
5. Arg2 Instances - Examples instances seen for the second actor if there was a class. The lexical head otherwise.

6-10: Fields 6-10 contain corresponding information about the second tuple (T')

11. Undirected co-occurrence counts - #k(T, T') + #k(T', T). Seven comma-separated counts corresponding to windows 1,5,10,20,30,40,50.
12. Directed co-occurrence counts - #k(T, T'). Seven comma-separated counts corresponding to windows 1,5,10,20,30,40,50.

b) Tuples files: Rows in the tuples files contain information about the individual tuples and their unigram counts.

Field description:

1. Arg1 - Semantic class of the first actor if available. [none] indicates no semantic class was determined.
2. Arg1 Instances - Examples instances seen for the first actor if there was a class. The lexical head otherwise.
3. Rel - The action represented via normalized relation string.
4. Arg2 - Semantic class of the first actor if available. [none] indicates no semantic class was determined.
5. Arg2 Instances - Examples instances seen for the second actor if there was a class. The lexical head otherwise.
6. Unigram count - Number of times the tuple was observed.
