relgram-extractor

The middle part of a pipeline to go from plain news text to learned event schemas.
This part of the pipeline takes in relation tuples extracted from the first part of the pipeline,
finds coreference information, and outputs relgram counts.

This README will be updated to be more useful in the near future. We promise.
